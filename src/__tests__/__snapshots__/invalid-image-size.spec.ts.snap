"Hello 👋
I am a bot. My job is to review your submission.

I reviewed your latest release, [invalid-image-size-v1](https://github.com/Platane/entry/releases/tag/invalid-image-size-v1). Its looking all good 👍

The image \`image_large\` does not meet the requirement, it should have a ratio of 300x200 (instead of 200x300)
