	"description": "If you are not familiar with orbital mechanics, please scroll down to get a quick explanation\n\n\nBackstory:\nIt's the year 2520, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, colonizing many planetary systems with the help of an advanced AI. This AI became so powerful it started to dominate many of the planets on the solar system, ruling mercilessly. Your objective is simple, help the humans remove all AI from the system. To do this you will need to mine resources, sell them, upgrade your ship, and help humans fight the AI in epic space battles.\n\nControls:\nYou can press F1 ingame to view the controls.\n\nOrbital Mechanics:\nThe game features N-body gravitation, so controlling your ship will be hard if you don't understand it. \nThe pink line that emanates from your ship is your predicted orbit, where you are going to be in the future, relative to your reference frame.\nAround your ship there is a circle with many markers on it, this is called the navcircle. It marks your velocity vector, and related vectors, relative to the reference frame:\n\n- Long Yellow Strip: Prograde, your direction of motion\n- Long Blue Strip: Normal, perpendicular to your direction of motion, points towards the planet in clockwise orbits, away in counterclockwise orbits \n- Short Yellow Strip: Retorgrade, opposite to prograde \n- Short Blue Strip: Antinormal, opposite to normal\n\nManeouvers:\n- Land: To land on a planet you should align your ship with the retrograde marker, and carefully burn, trying to keep your ship aligned retrograde, slowly approaching the surface.\n- Take-Off: You should burn until your orbit prediction is high enough. Then you will rotate so you face the normal vector, and burn until your orbit becomes more or less circular \n- Transfer: You could use advanced techniques, such as Hohmann transfers, to go places, but as the universe is quite small, and fuel is infiite, the easiest way to go to other planets is a (more or less) straight line. To do this, simply set the target body as reference frame and burn towards it, adjusting your rotation so your predicted orbit gets closer and closer. Then increase timewarp and wait until you are close, once near enough, burn retrograde to slow down and become captured by the gravity well.\n- Hover: You may want to stay over the surface to attack a city, simply wait until you are over your target, kill velocity and use your retro-thrusters, while facing the planet, to prevent falling down.\n\nTips & Tricks:\n- Make sure your ship is repaired before going mining, there is a chance that you will have an accident and suffer hull damage, which may leave you stranded \n- Upgrading your ship can make a fighter a really powerful warship, but it will be expensive\n- Selling ore on planets will increase human resources, which will mean more help when fighting the AI\n\nShips:\n- Fighter: Useful for moving around and engaging bigger ships, it's weak but fires really fast and is very agile\n- Freighter: Huge cargo, decent weapons, can do everything but masters nothing\n- Destroyer: Powerful gunship, heavy armour, but lacks speed and cargo\"\n\nPlanets:\n- Rocky Bodies: Rich on ore, they rarely have cities so they are a perfect target for mining \n- Deserts: They are usually dominated by AI, so be careful around them. \n- Terras: Humans prefer living here, so AI domination is slightly inferior \n- Asteroids: Like rocky planets, but very small. Useful for mining, or even as cover while on a intense battle.\n- Gas Giants: Giant spheres of gas. Don't land on them, it will kill you!",
